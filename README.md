# Shopping Tracker Project

This project was created as past of a frontend react assignment from the company Herolo. \
This is a simple shopping tracker to help keep track with your online purchases.\
The project is backed by frontend tests (written in cypress).\

Important to note, the project was created for presentation purposes, therefore it uses mock data, meaning the data is not persisted (the data you insert will not be saved in db, nor local storage). \
Local storage **is** used to save user preferences such as theme and currency.
